# tds-project1

- This project analyzes developer bios and their follower counts to uncover correlations between bio length and popularity.
- Web scraping techniques were used to gather bios and follower data from developer profiles.
- The findings highlight actionable insights for developers looking to increase their influence.

# Data Scraping
- To gather the data, a Python-based web scraping approach with libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests was used.
- The scraper accessed each developer's profile page, extracted the bio length and followers count, and saved these details into a structured dataset.
- Compliance with platform guidelines by adhering to rate limits and proper request headers was ensured.

# Key Insights
- The most surprising discovery was that longer bios—those that provide more detailed or personal information—tended to correlate with higher follower counts, up to a certain length.
- However, overly lengthy bios appeared to have a diminishing effect, suggesting an optimal length range for capturing audience interest without overwhelming them.

# Recommendation for Developers
- Based on the analysis, developers looking to increase their follower count should consider crafting a bio that’s both informative and concise.
- Aim for a bio length that provides key personal and professional highlights without exceeding approximately 15-20 words, as this range showed the strongest positive correlation with follower counts in the dataset.
